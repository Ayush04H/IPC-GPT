default of payment of a fine shall terminate whenever that fine is either paid or levied by process of law. 
69. Termination of imprisonment on payment of proportional part of fine.—If, before the 
expiration of the term of imprisonment fixed in default of payment, such a proportion of the fine be paid 
or levied that the term of imprisonment suffered in default of payment is not less than proportional to the 
part of the fine still unpaid, the imprisonment shall terminate. 
Illustration 
A is sentenced to a fine of one hundred rupees and to four months' imprisonment in default of payment. Here, if seventy-five 
rupees of the fine be paid or levied before the expiration of one month of the imprisonment, A will be discharged as soon as the 
first month has expired. If seventy-five rupees be paid or levied at the time of the expiration of the first month, or at any later 
time while A continues in imprisonment, A will be immediately discharged. If fifty rupees of the fine be paid or levied before the 
expiration of two months of the imprisonment. A will be discharged as soon as the two months are completed. If fifty rupees be 
paid or levied at the time of the expiration of those two months, or at any later time while A continues in imprisonment, A will be 
immediately discharged. 
70. Fine leviable within six years, or during imprisonment. Death not to discharge property 
from liability.—The fine, or any part thereof which remains unpaid, may be levied at any time within six 
years after the passing of the sentence, and if, under the sentence, the offender be liable to imprisonment 
for a longer period than six years, then at any time previous to the expiration of that period; and the death 
of the offender does not discharge from the liability any property which would, after his death, be legally 
liable for his debts. 
71. Limit of punishment of offence made up of several offences.—Where anything which is an 
offence is made up of parts, any of which parts is itself an offence, the offender shall not be punished with 
the punishment of more than one of such his offences, unless it be so expressly provided. 
2[Where anything is an offence falling within two or more separate definitions of any law in force for 
the time being by which offences are defined or punished, or 
where several acts, of which one or more than one would by itself or themselves constitute an 
offence, constitute, when combined, a different offence, 
the offender shall not be punished with a more severe punishment than the Court which tries him 
could award for any one of such offences]. 
Illustrations 
(a) A gives Z fifty strokes with a stick. Here A may have committed the offence of voluntarily causing hurt to Z by the 
whole beating, and also by each of the blows which make up the whole beating. If A were liable to punishment for every blow, 
he might be imprisoned for fifty years, one for each blow. But he is liable only to one punishment for the whole beating. 
(b) But, if, while A is beating Z, Y interferes, and A intentionally strikes Y, here, as the blow given to Y is no part of the act 
whereby A voluntarily causes hurt to Z, A is liable to one punishment for voluntarily causing hurt to Z, and to another for the 
blow given to Y. 
72. Punishment of person guilty of one of several offences, the judgment stating that it is 
doubtful of which.—In all cases in which judgment is given that a person is guilty of one of several 
offences specified in the judgment, but that it is doubtful of which of these offences he is guilty, the 
offender shall be punished for the offence for which the lowest punishment is provided if the same 
punishment is not provided for all.

73. Solitary confinement.—Whenever any person is convicted of an offence for which under this 
Code the Court has power to sentence him to rigorous imprisonment, the Court may, by its sentence, 
order that the offender shall be kept in solitary confinement for any portion or portions of the 
imprisonment to which he is sentenced, not exceeding three months in the whole, according to the 
following scale, that is to say— 
a time not exceeding one month if the term of imprisonment shall not exceed six months; 
a time not exceeding two months if the term of imprisonment shall exceed six months and 1[shall not 
exceed one] year; 
a time not exceeding three months if the term of imprisonment shall exceed one year. 
74. Limit of solitary confinement.—In executing a sentence of solitary confinement, such 
confinement shall in no case exceed fourteen days at a time, with intervals between the periods of solitary 
confinement of not less duration than such periods, and when the imprisonment awarded shall exceed 
three months, the solitary confinement shall not exceed seven days in any one month of the whole 
imprisonment awarded, with intervals between the periods of solitary confinement of not less duration 
than such periods. 
2[75. Enhanced punishment for certain offences under Chapter XII or Chapter XVII after 
previous conviction.—Whoever, having been convicted,— 
(a) by a Court in 3[India], of an offence punishable under Chapter XII or Chapter XVII of this 
Code with imprisonment of either description for a term of three years or upwards, 4*** 
5*

CHAPTER IV 
GENERAL EXCEPTIONS 
76. Act done by a person bound, or by mistake of fact believing himself bound, by law.—
Nothing is an offence which is done by a person who is, or who by reason of a mistake of fact and not by 
reason of a mistake of law in good faith believes himself to be, bound by law to do it. 
Illustrations 
(a) A, a soldier, fires on a mob by the order of his superior officer, in conformity with the commands of the law. A has 
committed no offence. 
(b) A, an officer of a Court of Justice, being ordered by that Court to arrest Y and, after due enquiry, believing Z to be Y, 
arrests Z. A has committed no offence. 
77. Act of Judge when acting judicially.—Nothing is an offence which is done by a Judge when 
acting judicially in the exercise of any power which is, or which in good faith he believes to be, given to 
him by law. 
78. Act done pursuant to the judgment or order of Court.—Nothing which is done in pursuance 
of, or which is warranted by the judgment or order of, a Court of Justice, if done whilst such judgment or 
order remains in force, is an offence, notwithstanding the Court may have had no jurisdiction to pass such 
judgment or order, provided the person doing the act in good faith believes that the Court had such 
jurisdiction. 
79. Act done by a person justified, or by mistake of fact believing himself justified, by law.—
Nothing is an offence which is done by any person who is justified by law, or who by reason of a mistake 
                                                           
1. Subs. by Act 8 of 1862, s. 5, for “be less than a”. 
2. Subs. by Act 3 of 1910, s. 2, for section 75. 
3. The words “British India” have successively been subs. by the A. O. 1948, the A. O. 1950 and Act 3 of 1951, s. 3 and the Sch., 
(w.e.f. 1-4-1951) to read as above. 
4. The word “or” omitted by Act 3 of 1951, s. 3 and the Sch (w.e.f. 1-4-1951).

of fact and not by reason of a mistake of law in good faith, believes himself to be justified by law, in 
doing it. 
Illustration 
A sees Z commit what appears to A to be a murder. A, in the exercise, to the best of his judgment exerted in good faith, of 
the power which the law gives to all persons of apprehending murderers in the fact, seizes Z, in order to bring Z before the proper 
authorities. A has committed no offence, though it may turn out that Z was acting in self-defence. 
80. Accident in doing a lawful act.—Nothing is an offence which is done by accident or misfortune, 
and without any criminal intention or knowledge in the doing of a lawful act in a lawful manner by lawful 
means and with proper care and caution. 
Illustration 
A is at work with a hatchet; the head flies off and kills a man who is standing by. Here, if there was no want of proper 
caution on the part of A, his act is excusable and not an offence. 
81. Act likely to cause harm, but done without criminal intent, and to prevent other harm.—
Nothing is an offence merely by reason of its being done with the knowledge that it is likely to cause 
harm, if it be done without any criminal intention to cause harm, and in good faith for the purpose of 
preventing or avoiding other harm to person or property. 
Explanation.—It is a question of fact in such a case whether the harm to be prevented or avoided was 
of such a nature and so imminent as to justify or excuse the risk of doing the act with the knowledge that 
it was likely to cause harm. 
Illustrations 
(a) A, the captain of a steam vessel, suddenly and without any fault or negligence on his part, finds himself in such a 
position that, before he can stop his vessel, he must inevitably run down a boat B, with twenty or thirty passengers on board, 
unless he changes the course of his vessel, and that, by changing his course, he must incur risk of running down a boat C with 
only two passengers on board, which he may possibly clear. Here, if A alters his course without any intention to run down the 
boat C and in good faith for the purpose of avoiding the danger to the passengers in the boat B, he is not guilty of an offence, 
though he may run down the boat C by doing an act which he knew was likely to cause that effect, if it be found as a matter of 
fact that the danger which he intended to avoid was such as to excuse him in incurring the risk of running down C. 
(b) A, in a great fire, pulls down houses in order to prevent the conflagration from spreading. He does this with the intention 
in good faith of saving human life or property. Here, if it be found that the harm to be prevented was of such a nature and so 
imminent as to excuse A's act, A is not guilty of the offence. 
82. Act of a child under seven years of age.—Nothing is an offence which is done by a child under 
seven years of age.  
83. Act of a child above seven and under twelve of immature understanding.—Nothing is an 
offence which is done by a child above seven years of age and under twelve, who has not attained 
sufficient maturity of understanding to judge of the nature and consequences of his conduct on that 
occasion. 
84. Act of a person of unsound mind.—Nothing is an offence which is done by a person who, at the 
time of doing it, by reason of unsoundness of mind, is incapable of knowing the nature of the act, or that 
he is doing what is either wrong or contrary to law. 
85. Act of a person incapable of judgment by reason of intoxication caused against his will.—
Nothing is an offence which is done by a person who, at the time of doing it, is, by reason of intoxication, 
incapable of knowing the nature of the act, or that he is doing what is either wrong, or contrary to  
law; provided that the thing which intoxicated him was administered to him without his knowledge or 
against his will. 
86. Offence requiring a particular intent or knowledge committed by one who is intoxicated.—
In cases where an act done is not an offence unless done with a particular knowledge or intent, a person 
who does the act in a state of intoxication shall be liable to be dealt with as if he had the same knowledge 
as he would have had if he had not been intoxicated, unless the thing which intoxicated him was 
administered to him without his knowledge or against his will. 
87. Act not intended and not known to be likely to cause death or grievous hurt, done by 
consent.—Nothing which is not intended to cause death, or grievous hurt, and which is not known by the 
doer to be likely to cause death or grievous hurt, is an offence by reason of any harm which it may cause, 
"
26,"26 
 
or be intended by the doer to cause, to any person, above eighteen years of age, who has given consent, 
whether express or implied, to suffer that harm; or by reason of any harm which it may be known by the 
doer to be likely to cause to any such person who has consented to take the risk of that harm. 
Illustration 
A and Z agree to fence with each other for amusement. This agreement implies the consent of each to suffer any harm which 
in the course of such fencing, may be caused without foul play; and if A, while playing fairly, hurts Z, A commits no offence. 
88. Act not intended to cause death, done by consent in good faith for person's benefit.—
Nothing, which is not intented to cause death, is an offence by reason of any harm which it may cause, or 
be intended by the doer to cause, or be known by the doer to be likely to cause, to any person for whose 
benefit it is done in good faith, and who has given a consent, whether express or implied, to suffer that 
harm, or to take the risk of that harm. 
Illustration 
A, a surgeon, knowing that a particular operation is likely to cause the death of Z, who suffers under the painful complaint, 
but not intending to cause Z's death, and intending, in good faith, Z's benefit, performs that operation on Z, with Z's consent. A 
has committed no offence. 
89. Act done in good faith for benefit of child or insane person, by or by consent of guardian.—
Nothing which is done in good faith for the benefit of a person under twelve years of age, or of unsound 
mind, by or by consent, either express or implied, of the guardian or other person having lawful charge of 
that person, is an offence by reason of any harm which it may cause, or be intended by the doer to cause 
or be known by the doer to be likely to cause to that person: Provided— 
Provisos. First.—That this exception shall not extend to the intentional causing of death, or to the 
attempting to cause death; 
Secondly.—That this exception shall not extend to the doing of anything which the person doing 
it knows to be likely to cause death, for any purpose other than the preventing of death or grievous 
hurt, or the curing of any grievous disease or infirmity; 
Thirdly.—That this exception shall not extend to the voluntary causing of grievous hurt, or to the 
attempting to cause grievous hurt, unless it be for the purpose of preventing death or grievous hurt; or 
the curing of any grievous disease or infirmity; 
Fourthly.—That this exception shall not extend to the abetment of any offence, to the committing 
of which offence it would not extend. 
Illustration 
A, in good faith, for his child's benefit without his child's consent, has his child cut for the stone by a surgeon knowing it to 
be likely that the operation will cause the child's death, but not intending to cause the child's death. A is within the exception,  
inasmuch as his object was the cure of the child. 
90. Consent known to be given under fear or misconception.—A consent is not such a consent as 
is intended by any section of this Code, if the consent is given by a person under fear of injury, or under a 
misconception of fact, and if the person doing the act knows, or has reason to believe, that the consent 
was given in consequence of such fear or misconception; or 
Consent of insane person.—if the consent is given by a person who, from unsoundness of mind, or 
intoxication, is unable to understand the nature and consequence of that to which he gives his consent; or 
Consent of child.—unless the contrary appears from the context, if the consent is given by a person 
who is under twelve years of age. 
91. Exclusion of acts which are offences independently of harm cause.—The exceptions in 
sections 87, 88 and 89 do not extend to acts which are offences independently of any harm which they 
may cause, or be intended to cause, or be known to be likely to cause, to the person giving the consent, or 
on whose behalf the consent is given. 
Illustration 
Causing miscarriage (unless caused in good faith for the purpose of saving the life of the woman) is an offence 
independently of any harm which it may cause or be intended to cause to the woman. Therefore, it is not an offence “by reason of 
such harm”; and the consent of the woman or of her guardian to the causing of such miscarriage does not justify the act. 
"
27,"27 
 
92. Act done in good faith for benefit of a person without consent.—Nothing is an offence by 
reason of any harm which it may cause to a person for whose benefit it is done in good faith, even without 
that person's consent, if the circumstances are such that it is impossible for that person to signify consent, 
or if that person is incapable of giving consent, and has no guardian or other person in lawful charge of 
him from whom it is possible to obtain consent in time for the thing to be done with benefit: Provided— 
Provisos. First.—That this exception shall not extend to the intentional causing of death, or the 
attempting to cause death; 
Secondly.—That this exception shall not extend to the doing of anything which the person doing it 
knows to be likely to cause death, for any purpose other than the preventing of death or grievous hurt, or 
the curing of any grievous disease or infirmity; 
Thirdly.—That this exception shall not extend to the voluntary causing of hurt, or to the attempting to 
cause hurt, for any purpose other than the preventing of death or hurt; 
Fourthly.—That this exception shall not extend to the abetment of any offence, to the committing of 
which offence it would not extend. 
Illustrations 
(a) Z is thrown from his horse, and is insensible. A, a surgeon, finds that Z requires to be trepanned. A, not intending Z's 
death, but in good faith, for Z's benefit, performs the trepan before Z recovers his power of judging for himself. A has committed 
no offence. 
(b) Z is carried off by a tiger. A fires at the tiger knowing it to be likely that the shot may kill Z, but not intending to kill Z, 
and in good faith intending Z's benefit. A's ball gives Z a mortal wound. A has committed no offence. 
(c) A, a surgeon, sees a child suffer an accident which is likely to prove fatal unless an operation be immediately performed. 
There is no time to apply to the child's guardian. A performs the operation in spite of the entreaties of the child, intending, in 
good faith, the child's benefit. A has committed no offence. 
(d) A is in a house which is on fire, with Z, a child. People below hold out a blanket. A drops the child from the house stop, 
knowing it to be likely that the fall may kill the child, but not intending to kill the child, and intending, in good faith, the child's 
benefit. Here, even if the child is killed by the fall, A has committed no offence. 
Explanation.—Mere pecuniary benefit is not benefit within the meaning of sections 88, 89 and 92. 
93. Communication made in good faith.—No communication made in good faith is an offence by 
reason of any harm to the person to whom it is made, if it is made for the benefit of that person. 
Illustration 
A, a surgeon, in good faith, communicates to a patient his opinion that he cannot live. The patient dies in consequence of the 
shock. A has committed no offence, though he knew it to be likely that the communication might cause the patient's death. 
94. Act to which a person is compelled by threats.—Except murder, and offences against the State 
punishable with death, nothing is an offence which is done by a person who is compelled to do it by 
threats, which, at the time of doing it, reasonably cause the apprehension that instant death to that person 
will otherwise be the consequence: Provided the person doing the act did not of his own accord, or from a 
reasonable apprehension of harm to himself short of instant death, place himself in the situation by which 
he became subject to such constraint. 
Explanation 1.—A person who, of his own accord, or by reason of a threat of being beaten, joins a 
gang of dacoits, knowing their character, is not entitled to the benefit of this exception, on the ground of 
his having been compelled by his associates to do anything that is an offence by law. 
Explanation 2.—A person seized by a gang of dacoits, and forced, by threat of instant death, to do a 
thing which is an offence by law; for example, a smith compelled to take his tools and to force the door of 
a house for the dacoits to enter and plunder it, is entitled to the benefit of this exception. 
95. Act causing slight harm.—Nothing is an offence by reason that it causes, or that it is intended to 
cause, or that it is known to be likely to cause, any harm, if that harm is so slight that no person of 
ordinary sense and temper would complain of such harm. 
 
Of the Right of Private Defence 
96. Things done in private defence.—Nothing is an offence which is done in the exercise of the 
right of private defence. 
"
28,"28 
 
97. Right of private defence of the body and of property.—Every person has a right, subject to the 
restrictions contained in section 99, to defend— 
First.—His own body, and the body of any other person, against any offence affecting the human 
body; 
Secondly.—The property, whether movable or immovable, of himself or of any other person, against 
any act which is an offence falling under the definition of theft, robbery, mischief or criminal trespass, or 
which is an attempt to commit theft, robbery, mischief or criminal trespass. 
98. Right of private defence against the act of a person of unsound mind, etc.—When an act, 
which would otherwise be a certain offence, is not that offence, by reason of the youth, the want of 
maturity of understanding, the unsoundness of mind or the intoxication of the person doing that act, or by 
reason of any misconception on the part of that person, every person has the same right of private defence 
against that act which he would have if the act were that offence. 
Illustrations 
(a) Z, under the influence of madness, attempts to kill A; Z is guilty of no offence. But A has the same right of private 
defence which he would have if Z were sane. 
(b) A enters by night a house which he is legally entitled to enter. Z, in good faith, taking A for a house-breaker, attacks A. 
Here Z, by attacking A under this misconception, commits no offence. But A has the same right of private defence against Z, 
which he would have if Z were not acting under that misconception. 
99. Acts against which there is no right of private defence.—There is no right of private defence 
against an act which does not reasonably cause the apprehension of death or of grievous hurt, if done, or 
attempted to be done by a public servant acting in good faith under colour of his office, though that act 
may not be strictly justifiable by law. 
There is no right of private defence against an act which does not reasonably cause the apprehension 
of death or of grievous hurt, if done, or attempted to be done, by the direction of a public servant acting in 
good faith under colour of his office though that direction may not be strictly justifiable by law. 
There is no right of private defence in cases in which there is time to have recourse to protection of 
the public authorities. 
Extent to which the right may be exercised.—The right of private defence in no case extends to the 
inflicting of more harm than it is necessary to inflict for the purpose ofdefence. 
Explanation 1.—A person is not deprived of the right of private defence against an act done, or 
attempted to be done, by a public servant, as such, unless he knows or has reason to believe, that the 
person doing the act is such public servant. 
Explanation 2.—A person is not deprived of the right of private defence against an act done, or 
attempted to be done, by the direction of a public servant, unless he knows, or has reason to believe, that 
the person doing the act is acting by such direction, or unless such person states the authority under which 
he acts, or if he has authority in writing, unless he produces such authority, if demanded. 
100. When the right of private defence of the body extends to causing death.—The right of 
private defence of the body extends, under the restrictions mentioned in the last preceding section, to the 
voluntary causing of death or of any other harm to the assailant, if the offence which occasions the 
exercise of the right be of any of the descriptions hereinafter enumerated, namely:—

1[Seventhly.—An act of throwing or administering acid or an attempt to throw or administer acid 
which may reasonably cause the apprehension that grievous hurt will otherwise be the consequence of 
such act.] 
101. When such right extends to causing any harm other than death.—If the offence be not of 
any of the descriptions enumerated in the last preceding section, the right of private defence of the body 
does not extend to the voluntary causing of death to the assailant, but does extend, under the restrictions 
mentioned in section 99 to the voluntary causing to the assailant of any harm other than death. 
102. Commencement and continuance of the right of private defence of the body.—The right of 
private defence of the body commences as soon as a reasonable apprehension of danger to the body arises 
from an attempt or threat to commit the offence though the offence may not have been committed; and it 
continues as long as such apprehension of danger to the body continues. 
103. When the right of private defence of property extends to causing death.—The right of 
private defence of property extends, under the restrictions mentioned in section 99, to the voluntary 
causing of death or of any other harm to the wrong-doer, if the offence, the committing of which, or the

apprehension of death, the defender be so situated that he cannot effectually exercise that right without 
risk of harm to an innocent person, his right of private defence extends to the running of that risk. 
Illustration 
A is attacked by a mob who attempt to murder him. He cannot effectually exercise his right of private defence without firing 
on the mob, and he cannot fire without risk of harming young children who are mingled with the mob. A commits no offence if 
by so firing he harms any of the children. 
CHAPTER V

107. Abetment of a thing.—A person abets the doing of a thing, who— 
First.—Instigates any person to do that thing; or

to be done, is said to instigate the doing of that thing. 
Illustration 
A, a public officer, is authorised by a warrant from a Court of Justice to apprehend Z. B, knowing that fact and also that C is 
not Z, wilfully represents to A that C is Z, and thereby intentionally causes A to apprehend C. Here B abets by instigation the 
apprehension of C. 
Explanation 2.—Whoever, either prior to or at the time of the commission of an act, does anything in 
order to facilitate the commission of that act, and thereby facilitates the commission thereof, is said to aid 
the doing of that act. 
108. Abettor.—A person abets an offence, who abets either the commission of an offence, or the 
commission of an act which would be an offence, if committed by a person capable by law of committing 
an offence with the same intention or knowledge as that of the abettor. 
Explanation 1.—The abetment of the illegal omission of an act may amount to an offence although 
the abettor may not himself be bound to do that act. 
Explanation 2.—To constitute the offence of abetment it is not necessary that the act abetted should 
be committed, or that the effect requisite to constitute the offence should be caused. 
Illustrations 
(a) A instigates B to murder C. B refuses to do so. A is guilty of abetting B to commit murder. 
(b) A instigates B to murder D. B in pursuance of the instigation stabs D. D recovers from the wound. A is guilty of 
instigating B to commit murder. 
Explanation 3.—It is not necessary that the person abetted should be capable by law of committing an 
offence, or that he should have the same guilty intention or knowledge as that of the abettor or any guilty 
intention or knowledge. 
 
 
"

Illustrations 
(a) A, with a guilty intention, abets a child or a lunatic to commit an act which would be an offence, if committed by a 
person capable by law of committing an offence, and having the same intention as A. Here A, whether the act be committed or 
not, is guilty of abetting an offence. 
(b) A, with the intention of murdering Z, instigates B, a child under seven years of age, to do an act which causes Z's death. 
B, in consequence of the abetment, does the act in the absence of A and thereby causes Z's death. Here, though B was not capable 
by law of committing an offence, A is liable to be punished in the same manner as if B had been capable by law of committing an 
offence, and had committed murder, and he is therefore subject to the punishment of death. 
(c) A instigates B to set fire to a dwelling-house. B, in consequence of the unsoundness of his mind, being incapable of 
knowing the nature of the act, or that he is doing what is wrong or contrary to law, sets fire to the house in consequence of A's 
instigation. B has committed no offence, but A is guilty of abetting the offence of setting fire to a dwelling-house, and is liable to 
the punishment provided for that offence. 
(d) A, intending to cause a theft to be committed, instigates B to take property belonging to Z out of Z's possession. A 
induces B to believe that the property belongs to A. B takes the property out of Z's possession, in good faith, believing it to be A's 
property. B, acting under this misconception, does not take dishonestly, and therefore does not commit theft. But A is guilty of 
abetting theft, and is liable to the same punishment as if B had committed theft. 
Explanation 4.—The abetment of an offence being an offence, the abetment of such an abetment is 
also an offence. 
Illustration 
A instigates B to instigate C to murder Z. B accordingly instigates C to murder Z, and C commits that offence in 
consequence of B's instigation. B is liable to be punished for his offence with the punishment for murder; and, as A instigated B 
to commit the offence, A is also liable to the same punishment. 
Explanation 5.—It is not necessary to the commission of the offence of abetment by conspiracy that 
the abettor should concert the offence with the person who commits it. It is sufficient if he engages in the 
conspiracy in pursuance of which the offence is committed. 
Illustration 
A concerts with B a plan for poisoning Z. It is agreed that A shall administer the poison. B then explains the plan to C 
mentioning that a third person is to administer the poison, but without mentioning A's name. C agrees to procure the poison, and 
procures and delivers it to B for the purpose of its being used in the manner explained. A administers the poison; Z dies in 
consequence. Here, though A and C have not conspired together, yet C has been engaged in the conspiracy in pursuance of which 
Z has been murdered. C has therefore committed the offence defined in this section and is liable to the punishment for murder. 
1[108A. Abetment in India of offences outside India.—A person abets an offence within the 
meaning of this Code who, in 2[India], abets the commission of any act without and beyond 2[India] 
which would constitute an offence if committed in 2[India]. 
Illustration 
A, in 2[India], instigates B, a foreigner in Goa, to commit a murder in Goa, A is guilty of abetting murder.] 
109. Punishment of abetment if the act abetted is committed in consequence and where no 
express provision is made for its punishment.—Whoever abets any offence shall, if the act abetted is 
committed in consequence of the abetment, and no express provision is made by this Code for the 
punishment of such abetment, be punished with the punishment provided for the offence. 
Explanation.—An act or offence is said to be committed in consequence of abetment, when it is 
committed in consequence of the instigation, or in pursuance of the conspiracy, or with the aid which 
constitutes the abetment. 
Illustrations 
(a) A offers a bribe to B, a public servant, as a reward for showing A some favour in the exercise of B's official functions. B 
accepts the bribe. A has abetted the offence defined in section 161. 
                                                           
1. Added by Act 4 of 1898, s. 3. 
2. The words “British India” have successively been subs. by the A.O. 1948, the A.O. 1950 and Act 3 of 1951, s. 3 and the Sch., 
to read as above. 
"
32,"32 
 
(b) A instigates B to give false evidence. B, in consequence of the instigation, commits that offence. A is guilty of abetting 
that offence, and is liable to the same punishment as B. 
(c) A and B conspire to poison Z. A, in pursuance of the conspiracy, procures the poison and delivers it to B in order that he 
may administer it to Z. B, in pursuance of the conspiracy, administers the poison to Z in A’s absence and thereby causes Z’s 
death. Here B is guilty of murder. A is guilty of abetting that offence by conspiracy, and is liable to the punishment for murder. 
110. Punishment of abetment if person abetted does act with different intention from that of 
abettor.—Whoever abets the commission of an offence shall, if the person abetted does the act with a 
different intention or knowledge from that of the abettor, be punished with the punishment provided for 
the offence which would have been committed if the act had been done with the intention or knowledge 
of the abettor and with no other. 
111. Liability of abettor when one act abetted and different act done.—When an act is abetted 
and a different act is done, the abettor is liable for the act done, in the same manner and to the same extent 
as if he had directly abetted it: 
Provided the act done was a probable consequence of the abetment, and was committed under the 
influence of the instigation, or with the aid or in pursuance of the conspiracy which constituted the 
abetment. 
Illustrations 
(a) A instigates a child to put poison into the food of Z, and gives him poison for that purpose. The child, in consequence of 
the instigation, by mistake puts the poison into the food of Y, which is by the side of that of Z. Here if the child was acting under 
the influence of A's instigation, and the act done was under the circumstances a probable consequence of the abetment, A is liable 
in the same manner and to the same extent as if he had instigated the child to put the poison into the food of Y. 
(b) A instigates B to burn Z’s house B sets fire to the house and at the same time commits theft of property there. A, though 
guilty of abetting the burning of the house, is not guilty of abetting the theft; for the theft was a distinct act, and not a probable 
consequence of the burning. 
(c) A instigates B and C to break into an inhabited house at midnight for the purpose of robbery, and provides them with 
arms for that purpose. B and C break into the house, and being resisted by Z, one of the inmates, murder Z. Here, if that murder 
was the probable consequence of the abetment, A is liable to the punishment provided for murder. 
112. Abettor when liable to cumulative punishment for act abetted and for act done.—If the act 
for which the abettor is liable under the last preceding section is committed in addition to the act abetted, 
and constitute a distinct offence, the abettor is liable to punishment for each of the offences. 
Illustration 
A instigates B to resist by force a distress made by a public servant. B, in consequence resists that distress. In offering the 
resistance, B voluntarily causes grievous hurt to the officer executing the distress. As B has committed both the offence of 
resisting the distress, and the offence of voluntarily causing grievous hurt, B is liable to punishment for both these offences; and, 
if A knew that B was likely voluntarily to cause grievous hurt in resisting the distress A will also be liable to punishment for each 
of the offences. 
113. Liability of abettor for an effect caused by the act abetted different from that intended by 
the abettor.—When an act is abetted with the intention on the part of the abettor of causing a particular 
effect, and an act for which the abettor is liable in consequence of the abetment, causes a different effect 
from that intended by the abettor, the abettor is liable for the effect caused, in the same manner and to the 
same extent as if he had abetted the act with the intention of causing that effect, provided he knew that the 
act abetted was likely to cause that effect. 
Illustration 
A instigates B to cause grievous hurt to Z. B, in consequence of the instigation, causes grievous hurt to Z. Z dies in 
consequence. Here, if A knew that the grievous hurt abetted was likely to cause death, A is liable to be punished with the 
punishment provided for murder. 
114. Abettor present when offence is committed.—Whenever any person who is absent would be 
liable to be punished as an abettor, is present when the act or offence for which he would be punishable in 
consequence of the abetment is committed, he shall be deemed to have committed such act or offence. 
 
 
"
33,"33 
 
115. Abetment of offence punishable with death or imprisonment for life—if offence not 
committed.—Whoever abets the commission of an offence punishable with death or 1[imprisonment for 
life], shall, if that offence be not committed in consequence of the abetment, and no express provision is 
made by this Code for the punishment of such abetment, be punished with imprisonment of either 
description for a term which may extend to seven years, and shall also be liable to fine; 
if act causing harm be done in consequence.—and if any act for which the abettor is liable in 
consequence of the abetment, and which causes hurt to any person, is done, the abettor shall be liable to 
imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to fourteen years, and shall also be liable 
to fine. 
Illustration 
A instigates B to murder Z. The offence is not committed. If B had murdered Z, he would have been subject to the 
punishment of death or 1[imprisonment for life]. Therefore A is liable to imprisonment for a term which may extend to seven 
years and also to a fine, and if any hurt be done to Z in consequence of the abetment, he will be liable to imprisonment for a term 
which may extend to fourteen years, and to fine. 
116. Abetment of offence punishable with imprisonment—if offence be not committed.—
Whoever abets an offence punishable with imprisonment shall, if that offence be not committed in 
consequence of the abetment, and no express provision is made by this Code for the punishment of such 
abetment, be punished with imprisonment of any description provided for that offence for a term which 
may extend to one-fourth part of the longest term provided for that offence; or with such fine as is 
provided for that offence, or with both; 
if abettor or person abetted be a public servant whose duty it is to prevent offence.—and if the 
abettor or the person abetted is a public servant, whose duty it is to prevent the commission of such 
offence, the abettor shall be punished with imprisonment of any description provided for that offence, for 
a term which may extend to one-half of the longest term provided for that offence, or with such fine as is 
provided for the offence, or with both. 
Illustrations 
(a) A offers a bribe to B, a public servant, as a reward for showing A some favour in the exercise of B’s official functions. B 
refuses to accept the bribe. A is punishable under this section.
