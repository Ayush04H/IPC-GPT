Explanation:
Abetting means encouraging another individual to commit any crime; therefore, it implies that one has intentionally aided the other's actions without actually performing them oneself.

Explanation:
The word 'abate' means ""to stop"" or ""prevent."" The act of encouraging another person's misconduct (such as insubordination) is known as ""abetting.""
In order to avoid ambiguity, we must distinguish between two different meanings of the phrase “in consequence.” In other words, it doesn't matter whether one acts on behalf of another individual who has already been convicted; rather than punishing them directly, he punishes those individuals indirectly through his actions.
This law applies not just to military personnel but also civilian employees working at government institutions such as airports, ports, railways, etc., whose duties include guarding national security secrets from being disclosed publicly."

Abetting means encouraging; assisting somebody else to commit a wrong act.
In this case, it was not necessary to prove that the accused actually encouraged the offence but merely proved that they provided some kind of assistance towards committing the offence.
The word ""assistance"" includes all kinds of help given from one individual to another without demanding anything in return.
For example - A gives money to B so that B goes out to rob C who happens to pass near them at night time.
Here both A & B are providing each other's support even though there is no direct connection between them i.e., neither A nor B demanded something from others like money etc.,
