The word ‘knowing’ means having knowledge; not merely being aware but actually believing that what one is doing constitutes theft. The fact whether there exists actual belief on part of person receiving the stolen goods will depend upon circumstances as well as facts known at relevant time when he takes possession thereof.

Explanation:- In case where no intention to steal appears from other acts committed alongwith this particular act then mere presence would amount sufficient evidence against him. It should however be kept in mind here that if some other criminal offense is alleged together with the crime of stealing then the prosecution cannot rely entirely upon his own statement alone without adducing independent corroborative material to show beyond reasonable doubt the guilt of defendant.

Example- A man steals a bicycle and hides its key somewhere near the scene of robbery. Later on police arrest another thief who had robbed the cycle before taking away the key and identifies him as guilty robber. Such identification does not make out the case unless the accused admits ownership himself and makes confession admitting all the particulars about the bike including its value etc., even though the said confession itself contains nothing more than suspicion. This rule applies both to oral statements made voluntarily by accused and written statements signed after interrogation by Police Officer

Whoever commits murder while committing rape:
Section 302",IPC_127,"If someone receives property knowing that its ownership has been obtained through robbery or other crimes like thefts etc., then he/she is guilty under this law.

Explanation:
The word “knowing” means having knowledge about something before taking action on it; therefore if one does not know anything regarding an offence committed against him/her, there would be no case as per this provision. However,
if anyone knows even after committing such crime but still takes possession over them without paying compensation/penalty from those who had suffered due to his actions -he will get convicted under this Act because according to our laws we cannot take back what belongs to others unless paid off first!
Therefore always make sure whatever you do don't break anybody's rights & respect their properties!"

Explanation:
Section 131 deals with aiding escape of prisoners from prison.
A person is said to aid an escape if he does not prevent it but remains inactive while the other persons do so.
The offence comes under section 132 dealing with abetting suicide.
This provision was added because many cases were coming before courts where some inmates had committed suicides due to lack of care on part of jail authorities.
In these situations, people tried to save themselves at all costs even though there was no law against helping others commit suicide (as provided under sections 134-136).
These laws came into existence when prisons began operating across India during British rule.

## Definition

The offense of “abetting” (also called “abetting”) refers to encouraging another person to commit criminal acts like murder or rape. The crime of “mutinies,” however, requires two people involved; therefore, we have defined the offense differently here:
Abetment means helping someone else do something wrong while knowing they will get caught doing so.

For example:

Suppose John goes into his neighbor’s home at night without permission and takes some money out of their safe. He returns after stealing all he could take, but leaves behind $1000 worth of jewelry on top of the cash he stole earlier.

John has just helped steal $2000 worth of valuable items! This act would constitute both theft AND ABETMENT OF MUTINY!

This definition applies equally well when one person helps another person commit a violent felony such as robbery instead of aiding him in breaking and entering. In those cases too, there must be two participants who are aware each other knows what they’re planning before carrying them through.

In addition, according to our legal system’s understanding of intent, anyone acting together toward achieving common objectives cannot claim",IPC_132,"If anyone commits any offence under this Act, he shall be punished with rigorous imprisonment for a term which may extend to seven years; and shall also be liable to fine.

Explanation:- The expression ""abetting"" means counselling another person to commit such act. It does not mean assisting him after he has actually done so."
"Description of IPC Section 133

The following are some examples:
• Threatening a police constable who was investigating a crime;
• Ordering a policeman into your house at gunpoint because you were angry about him not arresting anyone else;


In order to understand what it means to ""abate"", one must first have knowledge regarding how words like ""officer"" and ""soldier/sailor/airmen/aircraft personnel"" relate to each other. For instance, according to our law books (Indian Penal Code), there exists two types of people whom we refer collectively as officers - those employed directly under us (like government officials) versus those indirectly appointed by us through certain processes involving elections etc., but still answerable to us due to having been hired via recruitment agencies run by us themselves! This distinction between these categories has led many scholars over time to classify various acts done during wartime situations differently depending upon whether they occurred before World War I or after its conclusion.



To further illustrate this point more fully let's take three hypothetical scenarios:

Example:
A person encouraged another person to leave their job and join a rival organization. The second person left his/her job without informing anyone about it and started working as part of that group. Both these actions are punishable under this law because one is encouraging others to break rules while the other was breaking them himself/herself.



Explanation:

• This offence includes supporting the deserter's action by words (e.g., “You're free! Go!”) or conduct (such as providing shelter).
• It does not include mere encouragement when there has been no actual attempt at desertion made against the victim.
• In some cases, even if you did encourage your friend/deserter to go on strike, but he/she didn't actually follow through on those plans – then still technically violating this provision!
