The court will not impose more than one year's prison time on an individual if he/she committed the crime while acting under duress.

Explanation:
The offence relates specifically to negligence rather than intent; it does not matter whether the accused had maliciously intended that the state prisoners should escape (which would constitute culpable homicide).
A public servant cannot commit this offence merely because their failure was due to circumstances beyond their control - e.g., a fire broke out at a police station where many inmates were kept, causing some to flee. However, even then there must have been no wilful act done by them as well as other factors contributing towards the accident like inadequate security measures etc."

Explanation:
The word ""knowingly"" means that one knows what he/she does while doing something else; it implies an intent on his/her part to do so. In other words, if there was no intention then how would knowing help? So here we have two options-
1) If you are trying to aid another person in committing crime against law - i.e., aiding him/her to commit theft etc.; this offence will come under section 120B(2). This offence carries lesser penalty as compared to sections like 121A/122(A).
2) If you know about some event but don't take action due to lack of knowledge- e.g., you see somebody stealing your property without taking necessary precautions; in case of such offences where negligence plays role, the maximum punishment comes out to be imprisonment upto five years alongwith fine.

Example:

You witness robbery at night time when all people were asleep. You didn’t inform police immediately because you thought that nobody could catch them during dark hours.

Explanation:
The offense under this provision occurs if you encourage anyone else (such as your friend) to attack a higher-ranking official during that individual’s performance of duty. If they are injured because of such encouragement, then you could potentially go to court facing charges of “abetting” them into committing crimes against authority figures like police officers, judges, military officials, etc., even though it was not directly done at work.

For example:

Suppose two men were discussing how much fun it would be to rob some bank tellers after hours; however, one man suggested going undercover so he wouldn’t get caught doing anything illegal since there wasn't enough evidence yet proving him guilty anyway! This type of behavior falls within what's called ""abetting"" - meaning helping others break laws without actually participating yourself!

To prove guilt beyond reasonable doubt requires prosecutors presenting sufficient proof showing all elements present including intent & motive behind encouraging criminal conduct among those involved regardless whether these individuals acted upon suggestions given out loud verbally OR silently via social media posts online forums where people discuss breaking rules set forth legally governing society today...

This means courts must decide exactly WHAT actions did occur leading up towards creating consequences resulting FROM THESE CONDUCTS THAT COULD"
